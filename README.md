# Brief description of the process:

I started taking looking at the different layouts of each page in the design, after that I analyzed how I needed to "group" the different elements of the design to achieve the same layouts in css. With that in mind I started creating my github repository and adding my folder structure.

The code is separated by sections, trying to keep everything organized to understand the structure and for styling in css. I wanted to incorporate some of the bootstrap concepts we learned in class so I gave it a shot and added some of the classes. A obstacle I faced was how to use the grid of Bootstrap to create a gallery of images when a element takes two rows. This could be achieved trough dividing one of the columns elements into "sub-divs" which is much more time effectively than creating a grid.

Of course there's a lot of work left for this project but I think I put into practice the things I learned through the course and that this knowledge will help me to optimize my workflow in the long term.
